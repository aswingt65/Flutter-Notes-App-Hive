# Flutter-Notes-App-Hive
## Mulearn Flutter Bootcamp Project 1
### Problem Statement
Develop a Flutter app that enables users to create and save notes with the help of Hive for local data persistence. The app should have a screen where users can view a list of saved notes and create new ones. Each note should consist of a title and a description. The app should use Hive to store and retrieve the notes from the device's local storage. Users should be able to edit and delete existing notes, as well as search for specific notes using keywords. The app should have a simple and intuitive user interface to make note-taking easy and convenient.
